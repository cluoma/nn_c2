# nn_c2

A basic Neural Network designed to train on MNIST data. It is a simple network with 2 hidden layers.
The optimization is done via feed forward and backpropogation using a squared error cost function and sigmoid
neurons.

Built using the formulas found in [this book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html).
